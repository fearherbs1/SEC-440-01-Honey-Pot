# Prompt:
## Honeypot setup

### Purpose: Deploy an Active Directory based honeypot and monitor threat actors compromising the network.

Honeypots can create indicators of compromise that provide actionable threat intelligence to the internet community.  This project will allow setting up a honeypot within an Active Directory network and monitor and report on threat actor behavior.  Active Directory Honeypot information: https://www.kitploit.com/2021/11/ad-honeypot-autodeploy-deploy-small.html

When it is time to put the Active Directory honeypot on the network, the instructor will work with you to set it up.  The project will be documented on a public site with the status and activities that were detected along with any indicators of compromise, tools used, etc.

### Deliverables:  

1. Build the honeypot application and create a Windows Active Domain.  
2. Monitor the honeypot and watch threat actors behavior  
3. Write a report on at least two sets of unique threat actors that comprise the network and their activity, the tools they used, etc.
